                    Welcome to Aperture Syndicate. These Terms and Conditions govern your use of our website and the provision of all photography services. By booking a session or accessing our site, you agree to these terms in full.

                <h2 class="terms-heading">1. Service Agreement and Booking</h2>
                <p class="terms-text">
                    All bookings are subject to availability and confirmation. A non-refundable retainer fee (typically 25% of the total service cost) is required at the time of booking to secure your date. The remaining balance is due on or before the day of the session.
                </p>
                <ul class="terms-list">
                    <li>**Cancellations:** The retainer fee is non-refundable upon cancellation by the client. If the service is cancelled by Aperture Syndicate, the retainer will be fully refunded.</li>
                    <li>**Rescheduling:** Rescheduling is permitted up to 7 days before the session date, subject to photographer availability.</li>

                <h2 class="terms-heading">2. Copyright and Usage</h2>
                <p class="terms-text">
                    Aperture Syndicate retains the full and exclusive copyright to all photographs created. Clients are granted a limited, non-exclusive license for personal use only (printing, sharing digitally with friends and family).
                </p>
                <ul class="terms-list">
                    <li>**Commercial Use:** Any use of the images for commercial purposes, resale, or professional advertising is strictly prohibited without a separate written license agreement.</li>
                    <li>**Client Edits:** Clients may not alter, edit, or modify the delivered images, including applying filters or cropping, as this misrepresents the photographer's work.</li>

                <p class="terms-text">
                    Images are delivered exclusively via a private online gallery approximately 2-4 weeks after the session (delivery times vary for weddings/events). The photographer determines the final selection and editing style, which is based on the artistic judgment and professional standards of Aperture Syndicate.
